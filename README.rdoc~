Maps Project - Aidin

This application allows users to add addresses and give descriptions of the places they add. Other users can then see and add multiple comments to each place. The locations that are added can be added, edited and destroyed. The show view will give a map for the location in the world as well as what it looks like from Google Street view(if available) with help from the geocoder gem. When deleting a location, an AJAX request is used so that the location will be removed without having to refresh the index page(the location will simply fade out). Partials are used for both locations and comments.
